		<ul>
			 <li>Basketball: I love playing basketball and my dad installed a hoop in our backyard so I could always practice. I was also part of the Scarborough Blues until recently when it closed due to covid.</li>

			 <li>Cooking:Food is another one of my favorite things and I enjoy trying and cooking different cuisines such as Mediterranean and Indian. I usually cook with my sisters and we make things such as noodles, lasagna, and cupcakes. Whenever there is a special ocassion such as a birthday in our family, we always celebrate it with food.</li>
			 <a class="top" href="Gallery.html">Food Pictures</a><br>
			 <li>Photography: Whenever there's a pretty sunset or beautiful landscape, I always take a picture of it because although I'll remember it I also want to store it. I don't have that much of a passion for photography but I enjoy taking pictures.</li>
